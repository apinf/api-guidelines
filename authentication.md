### Authentication

Authentication is implemented according to functionality in [Restivus Swagger](https://github.com/apinf/restivus-swagger).

Each API documentation needs to have also login endpoint included, so that user is able to log in and explore the API functionality with Swagger document.

In endpoints, which do not need authentication, API key is needed.



_TBD:_

_Originally Jarkko says: _

* _We require API key in all GET methods. You can get it by creating account to Apinf system. Create it now from _[_https://apinf.io/sign-up_](https://apinf.io/sign-up)

_At the moment user can log in and get tokens: userId and auth-token.  _

_Are these the same or is something else needed?_
