### Introduction

> The API is an interface, through which many developers interact with the data. A good designed API is always very easy to use and makes the developer’s life very smooth.



> API is the GUI for developers, but if it is confusing or not verbose, then the developer will start finding alternatives or stop using it.



> Developers’ experience is the most important metric to measure the quality of the APIs.

  E.g.

  * list, delete, add, update are the **operations **to be performed on these resources.

* **Collections **are set of resources, e.g Organizations is the collection of  Organization resource.
