# Introduction

The APInf REST APIs are the interface, through which developers interact with the data. Our goal is to implement good designed APIs that are always very easy to use and thus make the developers' life very smooth.

> API is the GUI for developers, but if it is confusing or not verbose, then the developer will start finding alternatives or stop using it.

We consider the developersâ€™ experience to be the most important metric to measure the quality of the our APIs.
