### Versioning

When your APIs are being consumed by the world, upgrading the APIs with some breaking change would also lead to breaking the existing products or services using your APIs.

`http://api.yourservice.com/v1/companies/34/employees` is a good example, which has the version number of the API in the path. If there is any major breaking update, we can name the new set of APIs as `v2` or `v1.x.x`
