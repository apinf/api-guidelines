# API Design process

In APInf we use unified process for Platform API development.

## Design first

## Get feedback

## Modify design

## Get final review

- Ask feedback from trusted 3rd party API heavy consumers we have contact with. Get atleast 5 persons to do review. 
- Ask feedback to be added to API-portal feedback tab. Accept also direct feedback via other channels. 

## Implement
- Take into account last comments from final review
- Do code
- Pull OpenAPI spec from code and store in github. 

## Test


## Release

- Link generated OpenAPI spec to API in APInf.io catalog.
