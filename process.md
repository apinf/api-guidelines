# API Design process

In APInf we use unified process for Platform API development. Platform APIs are non-profit APIs. Our intention is not to charge clients for using them. They are part of the platform. 

[PIC HERE]

## Define typical use cases

## Design first

## Publish design for broad feedback

- Publish the design in apinf.io portal and post a tweet to Twitter (inlclude handle @apinf_io). 
- Write a blog post about new version development to medium.com/apinf 
- Everytime you find something that needs to be modified, do it and go to next step. 
- Most likely you will go back and forth between this step and next step for afew weeks. 

## Modify design and push back to apinf portal


## Get final review

- Ask feedback from trusted 3rd party API heavy consumers we have contact with. Get atleast 5 persons to do review. 
- Ask feedback to be added to API-portal feedback tab. Accept also direct feedback via other channels. 

## Implement
- Take into account last comments from final review
- Do code
- Pull OpenAPI spec from code and store in github. 

## Test


## Release

- Link generated OpenAPI spec to API in APInf.io catalog.
